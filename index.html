	  <h3>About me</h3>
	  <p>Hi, I am Aayush Srivastava, a 2nd year undergraduate student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. I am currently pursuing B. Tech in Computer Science.</p>

	  <h3>Interests</h3>
	  <p>I have a keen interest in emudev, system architecture and DSA.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>

	  <h3>Projects</h3>
	  <p>
	  <b>Chip8 Emulator:</b> I created an emulator for Chip8 in order to learn more about system architecture, working of CPU and basics of emulator development. The emulator is interpretative which means it reads the instructions written in the rom file one by one and performs necessary action as defined in the Chip8 documentation. The supporting hardware is includes a display, keyboard, timer and sound. Everything except sound has been implemented as of now. The emulator is written in C++ and Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL2) is used to implement supporting hardware. I have documented almost all the Chip8 opcodes/instructions in the CPU source file which you can find under src/chip8.cpp in the repo linked below.

	  <b>Image Viewer:</b> A very simple image viewer/gallery application made with Swing in Java. Created for a college programming course.

	  <b>Find nearby restaurant:</b> This was a twitter bot that I made in python for a hackathon in my first year. The bot used zomato's API and tweepy (wrapper for twitter api). If you tagged the bot's username in a tweet along with a location, the bot would search for a suitable restaurant in the location mentioned and tweet you back with a link to the restaurant.
